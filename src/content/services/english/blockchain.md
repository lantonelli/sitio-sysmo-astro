## Blockchain Development

We design and implement solutions based on **public or private blockchain** to add trust, traceability, and integrity to your processes. From smart contracts to asset traceability, we help governments and enterprises adopt decentralized technologies safely and effectively.

### Service benefits

1. **Traceability and immutability**  
   Every operation is permanently recorded on the network and can be audited.  
2. **Transparency and trust**  
   Systems without intermediaries that improve security and reduce manipulation risks.  
3. **Smart contracts**  
   Secure automation of business rules without human intervention.  
4. **Integration with existing systems**  
   APIs to connect blockchain with your processes, mobile apps, or back offices.  
5. **Lower operating costs**  
   Reduce manual tasks, duplicate validations, and reconciliations.  
6. **Compliance and auditability**  
   Infrastructure ready for certified, inspectable processes.

### Implementation strategy

1. **Use case identification** – analyze processes and pinpoint where blockchain adds the most value.  
2. **Architecture design** – choose network (public/private), nodes, smart contracts, and data model.  
3. **Development & integration** – build the solution, connect it to current systems, and deploy to the network.

### Let’s analyze your opportunity

We study your operation, current traceability, validation needs, and regulatory requirements. Then we design a technical proposal with the right blockchain stack (Ethereum, Hyperledger, Polygon, etc.).

### FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Which blockchain technologies do you use?</strong></summary>

Ethereum, Polygon, Hyperledger Fabric, and Algorand—choosing the network based on transparency needs, gas costs, privacy, and confirmation speed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can blockchain be used without exposing public data?</strong></summary>

Yes. We implement private networks or hybrid solutions that store sensitive data off-chain and record only digital fingerprints (hashes) on-chain.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does a typical project take?</strong></summary>

Simple cases (like asset registry or digital certificates) can be ready in 4–6 weeks. More complex projects with smart contracts and multiple integrations take 2–3 months.

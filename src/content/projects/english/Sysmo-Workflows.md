# Administrative Workflow Application

**Solution type:** Configurable platform for workflows and administrative task management  
**Sector:** Public and private organizations needing traceability and cross-area coordination

---

## What is the Administrative Workflow Application?

This application allows you to **design, configure, and execute administrative workflows** tailored to your processes, enabling organized, collaborative, and traceable operations. Ideal for organizations that coordinate tasks across multiple areas and users, ensuring each step and requirement is met.

---

## Main features

### Workflow creation

- Each workflow is composed of **configurable nodes** (steps or stages)
- Nodes can run:
  - **Sequentially** (one after another)
  - **In parallel** (multiple active nodes at once)
- Each node defines:
  - **Responsible areas**
  - **Assigned users/operators**
  - **Custom forms** with fields specific to the task

### Configurable forms

Each node can include a form to be completed by its assigned area, with fields like:

- Free text
- Numbers
- Dates
- Single/multi select
- Checkboxes
- File uploads

---

## User inboxes

Each operator has a **personalized inbox** to:

- See tasks assigned by area and node
- Complete the corresponding forms
- Upload additional documents if required
- Add comments or notes

---

## Flow and control

- The system **activates nodes automatically** based on configuration (parallel/sequential)
- Every action is recorded to ensure full traceability
- Real-time status of each request and node

---

## Benefits

- Standardized internal processes
- Flexible configuration of flows and forms
- Better traceability and task control
- Smooth cross-area integration
- Increased transparency in execution

The **administrative workflow application** turns scattered processes into controlled, auditable flows.

# Land and construction survey system in the Municipality of Moreno

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge

The **Municipality of Moreno** requested the development and implementation of a system to identify and survey land and buildings in order to notify and promote the regularization of tax obligations.

## âœ… Solution

**Sysmo** developed and implemented a system that enables the municipality to survey land and constructions. We worked with databases provided by the municipality to identify the properties to be surveyed. We cross-referenced ARBA data and various municipal databases. We geolocated and measured each construction. We worked with open maps, Google Maps, and drone captures.

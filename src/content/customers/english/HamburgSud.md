# Hamburg Sud Web Portal

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge

**Hamburg Sud** needed a web portal to make customer documents available online in an automated manner. They also required a system to streamline and view debt clearance for containers.

## âœ… Solution

**Sysmo** developed the corporate website for the company and implemented the portal in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.
Later, also for Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, a system was developed that allows the company's clients to perform calculations and view costs and container release times across all port terminals in the country. It also serves as a reference for terminal operators to check the status of containers.

## ðŸ§© Benefits

- Publication of customer documents
- Calculation and availability of debt clearance information
- Greater decentralization of tasks across terminals
- Standardization of services in the region (LATAM)

# Interface for BCRA notifications and resource management system

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge

**Maersk** required, in different stages, a system to manage resources and an interface for BCRA notifications.

## âœ… Solution

**Sysmo** developed a resource management system to manage workstations, offices, meeting rooms, and parking spaces across all facilities in its branches in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Employees can reserve resources, enabling a hybrid attendance model without issues.

In addition, an interface for BCRA notifications was created. This interface helps the company generate documentation for imports and exports required by the BCRA. The core functionality allows importing documentation from legacy systems, linking it, and generating all the information needed for these procedures.

## ðŸ§© Benefits

- Efficiency in resource management
- Integration with public agencies (BCRA)
- Standardization of services in the region (LATAM)

# Debt Clearance System for the Municipality of Berazategui

---

## ‚ùå Challenge

The process for issuing the debt clearance certificate in the **Municipality of Berazategui** was paper-based, sequential, and resulted in long delays.

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Sysmo** developed and implemented a web system that allows notaries to submit requests online and enables concurrent intervention of different areas (Cadastre, General Taxes, Building Works, etc.). This optimizes the work, significantly reduces processing times, and provides each sector with visibility into the status of the request.

- Optimized simultaneous work across areas, with visibility into the status of each request

# Debt Clearance System for the Municipality of Berazategui

---

## ‚ùå Challenge

The process for issuing the debt clearance certificate in the **Municipality of Berazategui** was paper-based and sequential across areas, which caused significant delays and limited visibility into the status of each request.

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Sysmo** designed and implemented a web system that allows notaries to submit requests online and enables concurrent intervention of the different municipal areas (Cadastre, General Taxes, Building Works, among others). The digitalized workflow reduces processing time, avoids rework, and provides end-to-end traceability for each request.
